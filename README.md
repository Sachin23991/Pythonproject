3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a vital part of any data science or analytical project. It helps in developing a deep understanding of the dataset, identifying any inconsistencies, and preparing the data for further analysis. In this section, we carry out a detailed EDA process on the NYSERDA Electric Vehicle Rebate dataset. Each step is described below, followed by its corresponding output screenshots and code.
________________________________________
Step 1: Viewing Basic Information of the Dataset
The first step is to explore the fundamental structure of the dataset using the .info() method. This command provides essential details such as the total number of entries (rows), the number of columns (features), the type of data stored in each column (e.g., integer, float, string), and the number of non-null (non-missing) values in each column.
This overview helps us understand the completeness and consistency of the data, and gives a general idea of how to proceed with further cleaning or transformation.
Code Used:
 
Screenshot and Output:
 
Step 2: Counting Unique Values in Each Column
To gain insight into the uniqueness of values across columns, we use the .nunique() method. This step tells us how many distinct values exist in each column. This is particularly useful for identifying categorical variables and understanding their diversity.
Knowing which columns have limited or excessive unique values is crucial in deciding how they can be grouped, visualized, or transformed in future steps.
Code Used:
df.nunique()
Screenshot and Output:

 
 

Step 3: Descriptive Statistics of Numeric Columns
We use the .describe() method to generate a summary of all numeric columns in the dataset. This includes key statistics such as the mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and percentiles for each numeric field.
This summary gives us a foundational understanding of data distribution, potential outliers, and the scale of each feature.
Code Used:
print("Summary statistics of numeric columns:\n")
print(df.describe())
Screenshot and Output:
Stastistical Summary
 

 
Step 4: Cleaning and Standardizing Column Names
For consistency and ease of reference, we clean up the column names by removing unnecessary characters and standardizing their format. This includes replacing spaces with underscores and removing any parentheses. These changes help avoid syntax errors and make the code more readable and manageable during analysis.
Code Used:
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.replace(" ", "_").str.replace("(", "").str.replace(")", "")
Screenshot of the code:-  
 

Step 5: Renaming Key Columns for Simplicity
Some of the column names in the dataset are long and complex. To simplify further analysis and enhance readability, we rename a few important columns with more concise titles. For example:
•	Annual_GHG_Emissions_Reductions_MT_CO2e is renamed to GHG_Reductions
•	Annual_Petroleum_Reductions_gallons is renamed to Petroleum_Reductions
•	Rebate_Amount_USD is renamed to Rebate_Amount
These new names retain the original meaning but are easier to use in analysis and visualization.
Code Used:
df.rename(columns={
    "Annual_GHG_Emissions_Reductions_MT_CO2e": "GHG_Reductions",
    "Annual_Petroleum_Reductions_gallons": "Petroleum_Reductions",
    "Rebate_Amount_USD": "Rebate_Amount"
}, inplace=True)
Updated Columns Screenshot:
Renaming Key Columns For Simplicity

 

 
Step 6: Identifying Missing Values
To ensure the dataset is complete and reliable, we check for missing or null values using .isnull().sum(). This gives us a count of how many missing entries exist in each column. Only the columns that contain missing values are displayed, allowing us to focus on cleaning or imputing only those specific areas.
Understanding where and how much data is missing helps us determine whether to fill in the values, drop the rows, or handle them through other data-cleaning methods.
Code Used:
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
missing_values = missing_values[missing_values > 0]
print("Missing values in columns:\n")
print(missing_values)
Screenshot and Output:
 
 

Step 7: Exploring Categorical Features
To gain insight into the nature of the categorical (non-numeric) variables, we calculate the number of unique values in each object-type column. This step reveals how many different values exist within each feature, such as vehicle makes, models, dealership names, or counties.
This is especially useful when deciding how to visualize these categories or whether they need to be grouped for better interpretation.
Code Used:
for col in df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns:
    unique_count = df[col].nunique()
    print(f"{col}: {unique_count} unique value{'s' if unique_count > 1 else ''}")
Screenshot and Output:
 
Step 8: Final Review of Column Names
As a final step in data preparation, we print all the current column names to verify that the changes we made earlier (cleaning and renaming) have been applied correctly. This provides a clear view of the structure we’ll be working with in the detailed analysis phase.
Code Used:
print(df.columns)
Screenshot and Output:
 



Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

4.0 Correlation and Covariance Analysis of Rebate Amount
________________________________________
i. Introduction
Before diving into visual interpretations, it is crucial to understand the numerical relationships between key features in the dataset. Specifically, we are interested in how the rebate amount—a critical financial incentive—relates to other quantitative variables such as GHG reductions and petroleum savings. This section uses correlation and covariance to explore these associations.
ii. General Description
The correlation coefficient helps assess the strength and direction of a linear relationship between variables. Covariance, on the other hand, measures how much two variables change together, though it is not normalized and is influenced by scale. Together, these two metrics provide a strong foundation for interpreting the dynamics of rebate distribution and its connection to environmental benefits.
We first clean the data by removing rows with missing rebate amounts. Then, we select all numeric columns and compute the correlation and covariance of each with respect to the Rebate_Amount.
iii. Code Used
 
iv. Specific Requirements, Functions, and Formulas
•	dropna(subset=['Rebate_Amount']): Removes rows with missing rebate amounts.
•	select_dtypes(include='number'): Filters numeric columns only.
•	df.corr()['Rebate_Amount']: Extracts correlation values of all features with rebate amount.
•	df.cov()['Rebate_Amount']: Computes covariances for the same.
These methods allow us to determine if the rebate amounts are data-driven based on performance metrics (like GHG or petroleum reduction) or not.
i.	Analysis Results
 
The results show that Rebate_Amount has a weak to moderate correlation with GHG Reductions and Petroleum Reductions. This implies that while there is some alignment between rebates and environmental performance, it is not particularly strong. Covariance results reinforce this, with slight positive values, suggesting only a mild tendency for rebate values to increase with environmental impact.
These findings indicate that the rebate system may factor in other considerations like vehicle cost, policy eligibility, or brand-specific offers, rather than being strictly performance-based. Strengthening the link between rebate and environmental contribution could improve the program's overall impact and efficiency.

4.1 EV Type Distribution Analysis
________________________________________
i. Introduction
Understanding how rebate incentives translate into environmental benefits is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of EV policies. This section investigates the relationship between rebate amounts and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, segmented by electric vehicle (EV) type—specifically Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
ii. General Description
A scatter plot is used to explore how rebates influence GHG reductions across EV types. Each point on the graph represents an individual rebate record, colored and styled based on the type of EV. This visual helps determine whether higher rebates lead to greater environmental impact and if EV type plays a role in that relationship.








iii. Code Used
 
iii. Specific Requirements, Functions, and Formulas
•	Function Used:
sns.scatterplot() from the Seaborn library.
•	Key Parameters:
o	x='Rebate_Amount': Plots rebate values on the x-axis.
o	y='GHG_Reductions': Plots GHG reduction on the y-axis.
o	hue='EV_Type': Colors points by EV type (BEV or PHEV).
o	style='EV_Type': Differentiates point markers by EV type.
o	palette='Set1': Uses a bold color palette.
o	s=80: Sets marker size.
o	edgecolor='black': Adds outlines for clarity.
o	alpha=0.7: Adjusts point transparency.
iv. Analysis Results
The scatter plot reveals some compelling patterns:
•	BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) tend to cluster in regions with higher rebate amounts and greater GHG reductions, suggesting they are both more expensive and more impactful in terms of emissions reduction.
•	PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) show lower rebate values and GHG reductions on average.
•	The clustering pattern in the upper-right corner of the plot indicates a positive association between rebate amount and GHG reduction—higher incentives are often linked with vehicles that offer stronger environmental benefits.
•	The visual differentiation using color and marker styles makes it easy to identify how each EV type contributes to the overall trend.

4.2 Rebate Distribution by EV Type
________________________________________
i. Introduction
While it's helpful to know how many rebates were awarded, it is equally important to explore the monetary distribution of those rebates across different EV categories.
ii. General Description
This analysis uses a box plot to compare the range, median, and spread of rebate amounts given to BEVs and PHEVs. It highlights which category receives more consistent or higher incentives.












iii. Code Used:- Rebate Distribution Vs EV Type
 
iv. Specific Requirements, Functions, and Formulas
•	Function: sns.boxplot()
•	Parameters:
o	x='EV_Type', y='Rebate_Amount'
o	palette='coolwarm' for contrast
o	linewidth=2.5, fliersize=4 to control outliers and borders
o	dodge=False to avoid overlapping plots
v. Analysis Results
BEVs typically receive higher and more consistent rebates compared to PHEVs. The interquartile range for BEVs is tighter, indicating uniform policy support. In contrast, PHEVs show more variability, suggesting that rebate values may depend on specific models or purchase conditions. This implies that full-electric vehicles are not only preferred but also more consistently rewarded, possibly due to their greater environmental impact. Policymakers may consider standardizing PHEV rebates to encourage wider adoption.

4.3 Correlation Between Key Numeric Features
________________________________________
i. Introduction
This section investigates the relationships between major numeric indicators in the dataset, including GHG reductions, petroleum reductions, and rebate amounts.
ii. General Description
We use a correlation heatmap to determine if higher rebates are associated with greater environmental benefits, such as reductions in emissions and petroleum usage.
ii.	Code Used
Correlation Between Key Numeric Features 
 
iv. Specific Requirements, Functions, and Formulas
•	df.corr() calculates Pearson correlation between numerical columns
•	sns.heatmap() visualizes those correlations
•	Custom styling with:
o	annot=True, square=True, linewidths=0.5, cmap='YlGnBu'
v. Analysis Results
There is a moderate positive correlation between GHG and Petroleum Reductions, which is expected since both reflect the environmental performance of EVs. However, the correlation between Rebate Amount and either of the reductions is weak, suggesting that rebates may not be strictly performance-based. This insight opens up opportunities to reconsider policy design—perhaps aligning incentive structures more directly with environmental impact to achieve better outcomes.

The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is often supported by government rebate programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and petroleum consumption. This analysis explores how the rebate amount is associated with two key environmental indicators: GHG reductions and petroleum reductions. Understanding these relationships can help policymakers evaluate the impact of incentives on environmental outcomes.
________________________________________
ii. General Description
This section uses a correlation heatmap to visualize the linear relationships among three key numerical variables:
•	Rebate Amount
•	GHG Reductions
•	Petroleum Reductions
Correlation values range from -1 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a strong positive relationship, values near -1 represent a strong negative relationship, and values around 0 indicate no linear relationship.
________________________________________
iii. Specific Requirements, Functions, and Formulas
•	Selected Variables:
Extracted three numeric columns from the main dataset:
•	corr_data = df[['Rebate_Amount', 'GHG_Reductions', 'Petroleum_Reductions']]
•	Calculated Correlation Matrix:
Used the .corr() method to compute Pearson correlation coefficients:
•	correlation_matrix = corr_data.corr()






•	Plotted Correlation Heatmap:
Used Seaborn’s heatmap function for visualization:

 
________________________________________
iv. Analysis Results
The correlation matrix reveals the following insights:
•	Rebate Amount vs GHG Reductions:
A weak positive correlation of 0.30 suggests that larger rebates are modestly associated with higher reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
•	Rebate Amount vs Petroleum Reductions:
A weaker positive correlation of 0.23, indicating a minor relationship between rebate values and petroleum use reduction.
•	GHG Reductions vs Petroleum Reductions:
A strong positive correlation of 0.87, confirming that efforts to reduce petroleum consumption significantly impact GHG emissions as well.
This implies that while rebates play a role, their direct impact on environmental metrics is limited. However, petroleum and GHG reductions are tightly interlinked, reinforcing the environmental benefit of switching from fossil-fueled vehicles.

5. Conclusion
The analysis of the NYSERDA Electric Vehicle Rebate dataset provides meaningful insights into consumer behavior, environmental benefits, and regional trends associated with EV adoption in New York State. Through a series of targeted visualizations and data explorations, we have uncovered several key takeaways that can support future policy-making and sustainable transportation initiatives.
We began by exploring the correlation between rebate amounts and environmental impact, where we found a modest positive relationship between higher rebates and greater GHG/petroleum reductions. This suggests that while rebates may not be the sole driver of environmental benefit, they do play a supporting role in encouraging more eco-friendly purchases.
Next, we examined the most popular EV models receiving rebates. This revealed a preference for specific models that are likely perceived as more efficient, cost-effective, or reputable, providing valuable feedback for both manufacturers and policymakers.
Our analysis of the distribution of rebate amounts using a KDE plot helped illustrate how incentives are typically structured. It showed that most rebates cluster around a specific range, reflecting a standardized state-level incentive strategy that ensures fairness and accessibility.
We also focused on county-level adoption patterns, where the top 10 counties demonstrated much higher rebate activity. These trends likely correlate with population density, public awareness, availability of charging infrastructure, and localized policy support.
Finally, the violin plot comparison of rebate amounts across EV types highlighted that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) tend to receive larger rebates than Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), which reflects both their higher environmental impact and state-level priorities in accelerating full electrification.
Overall, this dataset offers not just numbers, but a story — one that reflects growing public interest in clean energy, the effectiveness of government incentives, and the continued need to monitor and improve policy frameworks. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can enhance rebate programs, tailor marketing strategies, and further accelerate New York’s transition to a greener transportation ecosystem.
 

6. Future Scope
The insights drawn from analyzing the NYSERDA Electric Vehicle Drive Clean Rebate dataset provide a strong foundation for future research and development in the field of sustainable transportation. However, there is still substantial scope to build upon this work and deepen its practical and policy implications. The following areas represent meaningful directions for further exploration:

1. Causal Relationship Exploration
While this report has examined patterns and correlations, a future step would be to explore causal relationships. For instance, does a higher rebate directly result in greater greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, or are other factors like location, income level, or model efficiency influencing the outcome? More advanced statistical techniques—such as multiple regression analysis or propensity score matching—could be applied to isolate the impact of rebates more precisely.

2. Time-Series and Forecasting Models
If monthly or quarterly data were to be made available, this dataset could be used for time-series forecasting. This would enable predictive modeling to estimate future rebate trends, particularly in response to policy changes, technological advancements, or economic fluctuations like fuel prices. It could also help identify seasonal patterns in consumer behavior regarding electric vehicle purchases.

3. Geographic and Equity-Based Analysis
An important direction for future research lies in geographic equity. A spatial analysis by ZIP code, census tract, or county could uncover how evenly rebates are distributed across urban and rural regions. This could help policymakers identify areas that are underutilizing the program, potentially due to lack of awareness, accessibility, or infrastructure limitations.

4. Dataset Integration with Demographics and Infrastructure
The analysis could be significantly enriched by combining this dataset with external data sources. For example:
•	Integrating income or education data could help assess whether rebate programs are reaching low-income households.
•	Adding data on public EV charging stations could reveal whether accessibility to infrastructure influences rebate utilization.
•	Combining with vehicle registration data could help verify long-term usage and ownership patterns.
________________________________________
5. Application of Machine Learning
As the volume and richness of data grow over time, machine learning techniques could be employed to simulate policy changes or recommend optimal rebate values. Models could be trained to:
•	Predict how changes in rebate amounts might influence adoption.
•	Classify regions or customer profiles that are most responsive to incentives.
•	Segment EV models or counties based on environmental impact or cost-effectiveness.

6. Environmental Impact Validation
It would be valuable to validate the claimed environmental benefits with actual outcomes, where possible. This could involve tracking reductions in GHG emissions or petroleum use at the regional level. Matching rebate data with emissions reports or fuel consumption data would provide stronger evidence of the effectiveness of the program.

7. Public-Facing Dashboard or Policy Tool
A logical extension of this analysis would be the development of a real-time or interactive dashboard. This could allow:
•	Policymakers to simulate rebate programs and budget scenarios.
•	Citizens to explore how their county compares with others in terms of EV adoption.
•	Researchers and students to interact with visualizations and downloadable datasets for independent study.

Overall, the NYSERDA rebate dataset has significant long-term analytical value. As electric vehicle technology evolves and adoption increases, ongoing analysis and improvement of rebate programs will be critical in shaping equitable and impactful transportation policy. This project lays the groundwork, and future extensions can help ensure these incentives deliver both economic and environmental returns at scale.
